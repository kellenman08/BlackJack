# BlackJack
This is an ongoing project currently only able to run a few hands and print out desired output.
Things I would like to include are as follows:
  Finish the split function
  Add a friendly user interface
  Add card counting to the mix and vary bets off the count
  Output data to a .csv file to be able to analyze data in excel or sql
There are a lot more things that I'm sure I will come across but this has been a fun project so far and I look forward to continue working on it.
